# AGENT-LOG — append-only iteration ledger

Format per iteration (appended by the loop, step F): `iter, phase, task,
done-check cmd+exit, .loop log paths, artifact hashes, CHECKER evidence,
zoom-out note, next`. Sentinel lines (`LOOP STOP: …`) are always the LAST
line when present — see `docs/LOOP.md` §H.

- All research/spike/prototype branches merged onto main as the evidence
  appendix; PLAN.md / CLAUDE.md / docs/LOOP.md / docs/loop/* / licensing
  files / this ledger written. The loop has not run yet.
- To arm: README §Running the loop (branch agent/auto, scripts/loop.sh).
- First expected iteration: REPLAN on M0 (fix_plan.md items are seeded
  with `done-check: …` by design).
